"""
The poker game manager controls all basic operations of a Texas Hold’em poker game: rotating the role
of dealer among the players, dealing public and private cards, invoking and monitoring agent play (i.e., betting
actions), overseeing chips in the pot and in the agent’s local piles, and determining wins and losses, as well as
players who go bust (i.e., run out of chips). The manager should also create the poker agents at the beginning of
a series of games.
