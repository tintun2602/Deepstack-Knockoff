## Requirements 
This is a flask application using tailwind in the frontend. You need to install the following:
- Node
- Python
- pip

'''
pip install flask
pip install requests
npm run buildcss
'''

### GUI
### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
For the application's interface design, we've employed a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom CSS styling. Running 'npm run buildcss' generates output.css with only the essential Tailwind classes and classes used by the application included. This optimization reduces file size and greatly improves performance.
